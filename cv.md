## About:
Most of his life he worked as a worker (carpenter, builder, assembler, cabinet furniture), a couple of times he tried to engage in entrepreneurial activity, although he received a sobering experience unsuccessfully. Technologies and computer science were always interesting, I often helped friends and acquaintances with installing OS and programs, games, removing negative programs, connecting equipment. And I looked in the direction of IT and tried to study for myself, but I never considered it as the main activity due to problems with writing and reading, it was with difficulty that these two skills were always given to me, I seem to have mastered reading, but writing still causes difficulties. but thanks to modern software solutions, this problem has also been leveled.
At the moment there is a desire to master Front-End and most importantly JS, with this technology I want to make useful applications for myself and along the way to study technologies associated with a new round of development, the so-called Web 3.0
